# Tor-Denial-of-Service
basic flood attack for the TOR relay. if you download atleast give me a star

yes i am aware of it opening multiple processes for each request, this increases general attack power but can slow down or stop entirely after about 2 minutes
with extreme ease you can add a timer to reset the proccesses/kill them and start over.

requirements:

Pysocks

requests
